# DsKy4RPi
Apollo DsKy for Raspberry Pi

Will contain source, libraries and build notes for Apollo DsKy board for Rasperry Pi. I've seen a bunch of these boards created for Arudino, which is hugely limited to running AGC and other software. I've created a board via EasyEDA, which can be designed on their servers and they will create and send you a minimum of 5. I've stashed the board designs here also.
